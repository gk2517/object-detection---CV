Object Detection Using OpenCV and Sound Alerts


Overview
This project implements a basic object detection system using OpenCV for computer vision tasks and the winsound package for generating sound alerts upon detecting objects. The system processes video feeds from a webcam, detects objects, and triggers sound notifications when an object is detected.

Features

Real-time Object Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to detect objects in real-time from a webcam feed.
Sound Alerts: Triggers a sound using the winsound package whenever an object is detected.
